# Flo Tools
#Welcome!
Welcome to Flo Tools! This product was developed to enhance the usability and improve workflow for VoiceOver users of Pro Tools.
This document is divided into headings for easier screen reader navigation. Read below to get started.

#Acknowledgements:

Flo Tools was first developed as a concept by Chi Kim and Rocco Fiorentino, in the Assistive Music Technology Lab at Berklee College of Music. After the initial project at Berklee was completed, Slau Halatyn joined the team, and the group worked together to continue developing the scripts outside of the classroom. Many thanks to Chi Kim for his countless hours of creative scripting, to Rocco Fiorentino for his scripting contributions and providing documentation. And to Slau Halatyn, for his invaluable feedback and expert knowledge in Pro Tools. We sincerely hope Flo Tools will enhance the work flow of Pro Tools users with visual impairments!

#Note:

The  zip file referenced in this read me will automatically decompress itself into a folder on Mac OS. Please refer to this downloaded folder, called "Flo Tools Master", when reading this document.

You can download the zip file directly from [here](https://github.com/rfiorentino1/Flo-Tools/archive/master.zip)

#System Requirements:

Flo Tools supports Mac OS version 10.10 or later, and Pro Tools version 12.3 or later. Earlier versions of Mac OS and Pro Tools may provide limited functionality with Flo Tools, but have not been tested and are not guaranteed to function correctly.

#Installation
Flo Tools relies on a third party program, called Keyboard Maestro. Download instructions are below.

##Keyboard Maestro Installation:

1. Go to the Keyboard Maestro homepage by clicking [here](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) and download the Keyboard Maestro application from the website.

2. Copy the Keyboard Maestro application from the downloads folder to your applications folder. From there, open Keyboard Maestro.


##Flo Tools Installation
To install Flo Tools, go to the provided zip file, and open the file called "Flo Tools.kmmacros"

If successful, Keyboard Maestro should announce, "Successfully imported macros."

For the scripts to run correctly, open Keyboard Maestro Preferences, and under the general tab, check the checkbox that says "start Keyboard Maestro Engine at log-in."

##Note:
Keyboard Maestro is limited by a 30-day trial period. After this time, you will need to purchase a one-time license to continue using the program, and subsequently, Flo Tools.


###Getting Started

###Auditory Feedback:

Flo Tools uses 2 distinct sounds to provide auditory feedback. The first is [this sound](file:///System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff), which signals that something is in process and the user needs to wait for Flo Tools to complete a task. An example of this would be deselecting all tracks in a large session.

The second is [this sound](file:///System/Library/Sounds/Tink.aiff), which tells a user that something has been toggled, such as solo on and off.

###Commands:

Flo Tools has two groups of commands. The first, called "Flo Tools", is always active, and applies to the entire session. The second group, called "Flo Tools Inspector", is active by default, but can be toggled on and off. The inspector only applies to an individual track.

Below is a list of Flo Tools commands, and their associated functions, separated by their respective groups.

####Changing Shortcuts

The shortcuts outlined above are the default assignments for Flo Tools. They can be changed based on personal preference, however, when Flo Tools is updated, the shortcuts will revert back to their default assignments. If you feel that you want to change a shortcut, open Keyboard Maestro and do the following:

1. Go to the view menu, and select "start editing macros."
2. Find the Macro Groups scroll area and interact with it. Inside, find and select the appropriate Flo Tools macro group by pressing VO space on it.
3. Stop interacting with this area and move to the right to the macros scroll area.

  - Interact, and find the script with the shortcut you want to change. Press VO space to select it, and press tab.

This should move you inside the edit screen of the macro. VO right arrow, and you should see a button, labeled with the current shortcut for the script.

To change it, simply type your new desired shortcut and then stop interacting with the edit area. Be careful not to press command tab here, as this will assign it self as a new shortcut.


####Reporting Issues:

GitHub provides a convenient and reliable way to track and resolve issues. Please click [here](https://github.com/rfiorentino1/Flo-Tools/issues), and search for your issue. If you don't find an open issue relating to your problem with Flo Tools, you can create a new one by clicking on "new issue" and filling out the required fields.


####Known Issues

* Checking the arm state of tracks does not report consistently. This is due to the way that Pro Tools indicates whether a track is record enabled. To work around this, check the arm state multiple times.
